# Vendor Sales Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability in the retail and wholesale industry. This project utilizes data analysis to ensure the company avoids losses caused by inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, or over-dependency on specific vendors.

## 💼 Business Problem
Companies need to ensure that they are not incurring losses due to inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, or vendor dependency. The primary challenge is to transform raw sales and inventory data into actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
The goal of this analysis is to address the following key areas:

1.  **Identify Underperforming Brands:** Detect brands that are dragging down profitability to determine where promotional efforts or pricing adjustments are required.
2.  **Vendor Performance Evaluation:** Determine the top vendors contributing to sales volume and gross profit.
3.  **Bulk Purchasing Analysis:** Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs to optimize procurement strategies.
4.  **Inventory Optimization:** Assess inventory turnover rates to reduce holding costs and improve overall efficiency.
5.  **Profitability Variance:** Investigate the gap in profitability between high-performing and low-performing vendors.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Metrics Analyzed
